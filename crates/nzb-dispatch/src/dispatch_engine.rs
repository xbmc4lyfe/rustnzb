//! `DispatchEngine` trait — boundary between the job queue and the article dispatcher.
//!
//! This is the contract the queue layer depends on; it hides the concrete
//! `WorkerPool` implementation. The reverse direction (dispatcher → queue) is
//! already a decoupled channel (`mpsc::Sender<ProgressUpdate>`), so only this
//! one trait is needed to cleanly separate the two layers.
//!
//! A `DispatchEngine` is responsible for turning an [`NzbJob`] into article
//! fetches against the configured NNTP servers and reporting progress via
//! the per-job [`ProgressUpdate`] channel. It must be able to pause, resume,
//! cancel, and abort individual jobs, reconcile its worker set with the
//! server list, and shut down gracefully.
